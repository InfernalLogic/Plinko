UPDATE 1.03
  -Requirements for poppers popped achievements have been adjusted down
  -Autoplinker, Plink More, and Plink Faster upgrades now display their respective values when upgraded to max level
  -Coin, Peg, and Bumper income upgrades now display what the next level's value will be
  -Popper hunter acceleration slowly increases over time to help them catch fast-moving targets
  -Popper hunter targeting has been slightly improved, they may still miss some fast-moving targets

  -Popper hunter chance to spawn per level has been increased
  -Coin critical chance per level has been increased
  -The level loader now waits for all clone balls to be off the screen before loading the next level
