UPDATE 1.03
  -Added level completion bonus!
    Every time you complete a level, you receive a bonus equal to all the money you've earned in the last 30s multiplied by a percentage equal to the total times you've bought the "unlock levels" upgrade across all resets.
  -Requirements for poppers popped achievements have been adjusted down
  -Autoplinker, Plink More, and Plink Faster upgrades now display their respective values when upgraded to max level
  -Coin, Peg, and Bumper income upgrades now display what the next level's value will be
  -Popper hunter acceleration slowly increases over time to help them catch fast-moving targets
  -Popper hunter targeting has been slightly improved, they may still miss some fast-moving targets
  -Popper hunters now follow similar spawn rules to the clone ball upgrade; each time a popper hunter is spawned, it reduces that ball's chance to spawn a popper hunter by 1.0.
  -Popper hunter chance to spawn per level has been increased
  -Coin critical chance per level has been increased
  -The level loader now waits for all clone balls to be off the screen before loading the next level
  -Fixed a bug where multiplink achievements didn't save properly
  -Fixed a bug where the Autoplinker improperly reset its timer when the Autoplinker upgrade was bought
